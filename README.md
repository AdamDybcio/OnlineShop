# OnlineShop

This is my Android Studio project (one of many).
It's not perfectly made, but it was my school project, which was supposed to look exactly like on the screenshot below.<br><br>

- What is this project about then?
Well, it is a small online store where the customer can select a computer from the list, the number of 
computers and possibly accessories (mouse, keyboard, webcam). The price for the selected products is displayed at the bottom. 
In order for the customer to be able to place an order, he must first provide his data (name and surname, email, telephone number). 
When the customer fills in these fields and places an order, a toast is displayed stating that the order has been placed successfully. 
The order goes to the database.

In addition, an automatic message from the bot about the successful placing of the order and a list 
of products in that order arrives at the customer's email address.

In addition, an automatic SMS comes to the customer's phone number 
when the order has been placed successfully (unfortunately in this case, the customer sends himself this SMS, because I have no other 
numbers available for sending SMSes).

The application also has an "about the author" tab in the menu, which displays only my name and surname, 
and a "history" tab, which downloads all orders from the database and displays them one under the other, as in the picture below.

The entire project (including SMSes and email messages) can be displayed in two languages (Polish and English), depending on the user's system language
I did this whole project from scratch in two days. All made in Android Studio.
